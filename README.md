# About the project

A project made in accordance with the ft_printf project which is part of the Codam Core Curriculum. This project is pretty straightforward, you have to recode printf. You learn to implement variadic functions. 
You have to implement the following conversions:
- %c Prints a single character.
- %s Prints a string (as defined by the common C convention).
- %p The void * pointer argument has to be printed in hexadecimal format.
- %d Prints a decimal (base 10) number.
- %i Prints an integer in base 10.
- %u Prints an unsigned decimal (base 10) number.
- %x Prints a number in hexadecimal (base 16) lowercase format.
- %X Prints a number in hexadecimal (base 16) uppercase format.
- %% Prints a percent sign

# Getting started

Start by cloning the repository:
```c
https://github.com/fkoolhoven/ft_printf.git
```

Compile by using make:
```c
make
```

# Usage

To use the library functions in your code, simply include its header:
```c
#include "ft_printf.h"
```


# Important learnings
1. I learned how to write variadic functions.
2. I learned about the specifics of various conversions and was introduced to working with hexadecimals.
